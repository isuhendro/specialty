# Specialty

Like a chef cooks a specialty, and choose the best ingredients; herewith my pick of choices for the JS framework, server-side, and infrastructure option to build my software.
The imaginative software called Specialty should perform like the following

- It must look good
- It must run fast
- It should be extensible as a massive software and hence could be maintained easily in a large team
- It should run in less than 20\$ monthly
- It starts as a website and would have its native client

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/isuhendro/gin-react
docker build . -t specialty
docker run -i -t -p 5000:5000 specialty
```
